**Notes:**

- Replace `https://github.com/yourusername/my-package.git` with the actual URL of your Git repository.
- Update the "Usage" section with specific instructions relevant to your project.
- Fill in the "Features," "Contributing," and "Contact" sections with appropriate details.
- Ensure that you have an `environment.yml` file in your project root that specifies all the dependencies.

**Example `environment.yml` File:**

Here's an example of what your `environment.yml` file might look like:

```yaml
name: my-package
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.9
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scipy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - rdkit
  - openbabel
  - pip
  - pip:
    - py3dmol
    - other-pip-only-packages
```

**Additional Steps (if needed):**

- If you need to install packages that are only available via `pip`, include them under the `pip` section in your `environment.yml` file.
- After activating the environment, you can verify the installation by running:

  ```bash
  python --version
  ```

  This should display the Python version specified in your `environment.yml` file.
